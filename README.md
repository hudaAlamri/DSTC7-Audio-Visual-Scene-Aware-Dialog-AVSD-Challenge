## - Track Description
Welcome to the Audio Visual Scene-Aware Dialog (AVSD) challenge and dataset. This challenge is one track of  the **7th Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC7) workshop.**
The task is to build a system that generates responses in a dialog about an input video.

### - Tasks

In this challenge, the system must generate responses to a user input in the context of a given dialog.  
This context consists of a dialog history (previous utterances by both user and system) in addition to video and audio information that comprise the scene. 
The quality of a system’s automatically generated sentences is evaluated using objective measures to determine whether or not the generated responses are natural and informative.

#### 1. Task 1: Video and Text 
    a. Use the video and text training data provided but no external data sources, 
       other than publicly available pre-trained feature extraction models.

    b. External data may also be used for training.

#### 2. Task 2: Text Only 
    a. Do not use the input videos for training or testing. 
       Use only the text training data (dialogs and video descriptions) provided. 
    b. Any publicly available text data may also be used for training.
